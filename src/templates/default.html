  <p class="lead">This is a simple demo system to show how to integrate CoverMyMeds into your system using the <a href="https://docs-api.covermymeds.com/">CoverMyMeds API</a>. You will need to create four interface elements:</p>

  <p class="">1. a button to start a prior authorization while the provider is working with an electronic prescription.</p>
  <p class="">2. a prior authorization task list which will be used to show the PAs being worked upon.</p>
  <p class="">3. a form to start a new prior authorization.</p>
  <p class="">4. a contact page so CoverMyMeds can help your users.</p>
